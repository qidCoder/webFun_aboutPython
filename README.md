Coding Dojo assignment


Break down the image below into proper HTML and CSS.
Make sure you've validated your HTML and that you're not using any float: left or right.

For the ">>" on the list, don't worry about making it look exactly like >>. You can just use a normal circle for this assignment.
Do NOT make this responsive.  Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 970px).  You will go through our responsive design course later. For now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first.
